     * Dial a number or SIP URI from a given connection. A successful response will
     * include a `call_leg_id` which can be used to correlate the command with
     * subsequent webhooks.
     *
     * **Expected Webhooks:**
     *
     * - `call.initiated`
     * - `call.answered` or `call.hangup`
     * - `call.machine.detection.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested
     * - `call.machine.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested
     *   to detect the end of machine greeting
     * - `call.machine.premium.detection.ended` if
     *   `answering_machine_detection=premium` was requested
     * - `call.machine.premium.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection=premium`
     *   was requested and a beep was detected
     * - `streaming.started`, `streaming.stopped` or `streaming.failed` if `stream_url`
     *   was set
     *
     * When the `record` parameter is set to `record-from-answer`, the response will
     * include a `recording_id` field.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const response = await client.calls.dial({
     *   connection_id: '7267xxxxxxxxxxxxxx',
     *   from: '+18005550101',
     *   to: '+18005550100 or sip:username@sip.telnyx.com',
     * });
