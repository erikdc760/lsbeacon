     * Before creating a campaign, use the
     * [Qualify By Usecase endpoint](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/campaign/qualify-by-usecase)
     * to ensure that the brand you want to assign a new campaign to is qualified for
     * the desired use case of that campaign. **Please note:** After campaign creation,
     * you'll only be able to edit the campaign's sample messages. Creating a campaign
     * will entail an upfront, non-refundable three month's cost that will depend on
     * the campaign's use case
     * ([see 10DLC Costs section for details](https://developers.telnyx.com/api-reference/campaign/get-campaign-cost)).
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const telnyxCampaignCsp =
     *   await client.messaging10dlc.campaignBuilder.submit({
     *     brandId: 'brandId',
     *     description: 'description',
     *     usecase: 'usecase',
     *   });
