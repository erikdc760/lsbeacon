     * Perform embedding on a Telnyx Storage Bucket using the a embedding model. The
     * current supported file types are:
     *
     * - PDF
     * - HTML
     * - txt/unstructured text files
     * - json
     * - csv
     * - audio / video (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm ) - Max of 100mb file
     *   size.
     *
     * Any files not matching the above types will be attempted to be embedded as
     * unstructured text.
     *
     * This process can be slow, so it runs in the background and the user can check
     * the status of the task using the endpoint `/ai/embeddings/{task_id}`.
     *
     * **Important Note**: When you update documents in a Telnyx Storage bucket, their
     * associated embeddings are automatically kept up to date. If you add or update a
     * file, it is automatically embedded. If you delete a file, the embeddings are
     * deleted for that particular file.
     *
     * You can also specify a custom `loader` param. Currently the only supported
     * loader value is `intercom` which loads Intercom article jsons as specified by
     * [the Intercom article API](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/Articles/article/)
     * This loader will split each article into paragraphs and save additional
     * parameters relevant to Intercom docs, such as `article_url` and `heading`. These
     * values will be returned by the `/v2/ai/embeddings/similarity-search` endpoint in
     * the `loader_metadata` field.
     *
     * @example
     * ```ts
     * const embeddingResponse = await client.ai.embeddings.create(
     *   { bucket_name: 'bucket_name' },
     * );
     * ```

     * return a `distance` between 0 and 1. The lower the distance, the more similar
     * the returned document chunks are to the query. A `certainty` will also be
     * returned, which is a value between 0 and 1 where the higher the certainty, the
